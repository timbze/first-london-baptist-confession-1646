# First London Baptist Confession of 1646

### The first edition was published in 1644. This second edition "corrected and enlarged" was originally published in 1646.

### The work here also includes an Addendum by Benjamin Cox

The text of the confession was first retrieved from [reformedreader.org](http://www.reformedreader.org/ccc/1646lbc.htm). The text of the addendum is from [apuritansmind.com](https://www.apuritansmind.com/creeds-and-confessions/an-appendix-to-the-baptist-confession-of-faith-by-benjamin-cox/)

Some corrections were applied from the information found [here](http://kinseydrivebaptistchurch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/LONDON-BAPTIST.pdf). A note was added for each reference change, signifying the original reference in the text.

**Note: The table of contents uses osisRef with "/"**, which does not currently (2020-06-22) validate to OSIS schema. Note about it was added [here](https://wiki.crosswire.org/OSIS_211_CR#Correct_the_osisRef_syntax_for_a_non-verse-keyed_OSIS_module) by David Haslam. Also see issue [#9](https://github.com/timbze/first-london-baptist-confession-1646/issues/9)
